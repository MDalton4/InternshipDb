# Internship Database

At its simplest, this application is a searchable database. The psychology department has a collection of internships, and it’s important the students have access to this information. This web application will allow students to search through internships, faculty to extract analytics, and administrators to update information. Not only will this application help students find internships, but it will also help the faculty track students’ interest. With trend data and students’ opinions, the Field Placement Coordinator can seek out different employers who are more appealing to the students. Ultimately, the application will exist to streamline the process for everyone. Students will have an easier, and faster, time finding internships, and the faculty will be better equipped to provide students with the best opportunities.
